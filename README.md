# monodb

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database which stores data (BSON) in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema. It means you can store your records without worrying about the data structure such as the number of fields or types of fields to store values. Companies and development teams of all sizes use MongoDB because: The document data model is a powerful way to store and retrieve data that allows developers to move fast.

In MongoDB, we cannot establish such a relationship between the unstructured data of the collections. Hence it is considered as a non-relational database. MongoDB works on concept of collection and document. A group of document is refered as collection.
A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.

    db.movie.insertMany([
        {name: "I am number four", year: 1995, rating: "18+", genre: "sci-fi", language: "American English"},
        {name: "Teens", year: 2001, rating: "18+", genre: "sci-fi", language: ["American English","Dubbed"]},
